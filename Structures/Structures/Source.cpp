Create an Enum called CharacterCaseType,
Character case type should have 3 values: CC_UPPER_CLASS, CC_LOWER_CLASS, and CC_EITHER.
Using this enum, modify the getCharacter function you wrote to modify the input to one of these values depending on the value
of the CharacterCaseType(e.g if it was CC_LOWER_CASE, all input would come out lower case from GetCharacter)
